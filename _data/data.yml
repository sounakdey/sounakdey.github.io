    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a Research Scholar (Doctoral Fellow) in Computer Science 
      at Computer Vision Center, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona,
      Barcelona, Spain. A enthusiastic programmer and a ML/VISION reasearcher.
      I am a researcher in Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning
      and related fields. Currently, I am a PhD. student, under the supervision 
      of Dr. Josep Lladós and Prof. Dr. Umapada Pal. My main research interest 
      includes computer vision, pattern recognition and image processing. In particular,
      I work with multi-modal data embedding in common sub space, structural pattern 
      recognition, and apply them for various applications such as natural language processing, 
      sketch based image retrieval, object detection, recognition etc.
